        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
        <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
        <p>We collect information from you when you register on the site, place an order, enter a contest or sweepstake, respond to a survey or email, or participate in another site feature.</p>
        <p>When ordering or registering, we may ask you for your name, email address, postal address, phone number, card details or other information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.</p>
        <p>We also collect information about gift recipients so that we can fulfil the order. The information we collect about gift recipients is not used for marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>Like many websites, we use cookies to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors and visits to our websites. For information about cookies and how we use them, please refer to the ‘Do we use cookies?’ section below.</p>
        <h3>How do we use your information?</h3>
        <p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register, buy products, enter a contest or promotion, respond to a survey or marketing email, surf the website or use other site features in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To personalise your site experience and allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings you are most interested in.</li>
          <li>To improve our response to customer-service requests.</li>
          <li>To process transactions quickly.</li>
          <li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.</li>
          <li>If you have opted to receive our email newsletter, we may send you occasional emails. If you no longer wish to receive these emails, please see: ‘How can you opt out, remove or modify information you have provided to us?’ If you have not opted to receive email newsletters, you will not receive them. Visitors who register or participate in other site features, such as marketing programs and members-only content will be asked if they would like to be on our mailing list and receive email communications from us.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How do we protect visitor information?</h3>
        <p>We implement a number of security measures to ensure the safety of your personal information. Your information is stored behind secured networks and is only accessible to a limited number of people. They have special-access rights to such systems and are required to keep information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.</p>
        <h3>Do we use ‘cookies’?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser (if you allow it). This enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognise your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences, based on previous or current site activity, helping us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction, so we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
        <p>We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf, except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>
        <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (eg. Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is slightly different so look at the Help menu to find out the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. But you can still place orders over the telephone by calling customer services.</p>
        <h3>Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice, except as described below. The term ‘outside parties’ does not include Cheer Love.  It also does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.
        However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
        <h3>How can you opt-out, remove or modify information you have provided to us?</h3>
        <p>To change your email subscriptions, please let us know by changing your preferences in the ‘My Account’ section. Please note that, due to email production schedules, you may receive any emails already in production.</p>
        <p>To delete all your online account information from our database, sign into the ‘My Account’ section and remove your shipping address, billing address and payment information. Please note that we may maintain information about an individual sales transaction in order to service that transaction and for record keeping.</p>
